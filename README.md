# MSc Project

This repository contains code for my Master's thesis project. All data and other resources are not present, but should somewhat be clear from the code implementation what is going on. 

## Project Structure

- `1d_experiment/`: One-dimensional experiment implementations
- `2d_upscaling/`: Two-dimensional upscaling models
- `2d_concentration/`: Two-dimensional concentration simulations with active matter
